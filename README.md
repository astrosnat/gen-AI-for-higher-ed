# gen-AI-for-higher-ed
A collection of interesting papers about how well generative AI works in different higher education settings.

## Why does this exist?
Because we're starting to get to the point where we can codify best practice in using generative AI in the university. This linkpost is for anyone looking to understand what generative AI can and can't do in the classroom, and where it's most useful.

## I want to add stuff!
That's great! Make a pull request. Please comment what you've added and why. Suggestions, comments and PR are all very welcome.

## Help, the links don't work!
Comment. Better yet: make a pull request to fix the links!
